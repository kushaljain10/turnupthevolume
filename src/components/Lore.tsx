            In his victory speech on 4 November 2025, following his election as New York City’s mayor, <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong> — a 34-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman — directly addressed President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> with the phrase <strong>“Turn the volume up.”</strong> It was a bold, defiant challenge, urging Trump to escalate his attacks and opposition efforts against Mamdani’s progressive agenda.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The remark landed amid Mamdani’s pledge to dismantle the systemic inequalities, corruption, and cronyism that he argued enabled Trump’s rise. The message: <strong>terrify a despot</strong> by confronting those power structures — ending tax loopholes for billionaires, expanding labour protections, making public transit free, and protecting immigrants, the trans community, and other marginalised groups from federal overreach.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            By daring Trump to <strong>turn the volume up</strong>, Mamdani signalled that New York City — where Trump built his empire — would lead national resistance, united in solidarity: <strong>“to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.”</strong> Intensified conflict would only amplify the mandate for transformative change.

            Trump, who had called Mamdani a “communist” and threatened to withhold federal funding, appeared to answer in real time on Truth Social: <strong>“…AND SO IT BEGINS!”</strong>

          <p className="mt-4">
            <strong>$VOLUME</strong> channels that energy — not as politics, but as <strong>collective signal</strong>. When they turn it up, <strong>we turn up together</strong>.
